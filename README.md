# SleepCalculator
A simple Python program to calculate sleep times in cycles.


You are able to see recommended times for you to wake up according to your current time, or calculate the best time for you to fall asleep by choosing a certain time you'd like to wake up in the morning. 
Program assumes that person takes 15 minutes to fall asleep and adds onto times.
Also features the option to add onto this fall asleep time - in Settings, you may adjust the extra amount of time (in minutes) that you would like to add onto the preexisting 15 minute extra time it takes to fall asleep.
